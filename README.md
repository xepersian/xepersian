# The xepersian Package
The `xepersian` package provides a convenient interface for typesetting 
Persian and English documents with LaTeX format in XeTeX and LuaTeX engines.

The package includes adaptations for use with many other commonly-used 
packages.

The name `xepersian`is derived from the words **_experience_** and **_persian_** and captures my philosophy of writing the package for **_the best Persian typesetting experience in TeX_**.

## Note
