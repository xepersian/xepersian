# The xepersian Package
The `xepersian` package provides a convenient interface for typesetting 
Persian and English documents with LaTeX format in XeTeX and LuaTeX engines.

The package includes adaptations for use with many other commonly-used 
packages.

The name `xepersian`is derived from the words **_experience_** and **_persian_** and captures my philosophy of writing the package for **_the best Persian typesetting experience in TeX_**.

The official versions of the package are released on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/xepersian).

## Using the Package
The following example illustrates how the package can be used.
````tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xepersian}
\settextfont{<fontname>}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
````
