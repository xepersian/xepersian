> The index to Digital Typography lists eleven pages where the importance of stability is stressed, and I urge all maintainers of TeX and METAFONT to read them again every few years. Any object of nontrivial complexity is non-optimum, in the sense that it can be improved in some way (while still remaining non-optimum); therefore there’s always a reason to change anything that isn’t trivial. But one of TeX’s principal advantages is the fact that it does not change—except for serious flaws whose correction is unlikely to affect more than a very tiny number of archival documents.
